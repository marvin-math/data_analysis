# python-assignment
This program requires no interaction of the viewer/supervisor. The code and 
results are displayed in a jupyter (ipynb) file. My assignment is the jupyter file,
I just added a python file for the sake of completeness (so if it was not necessary to hand in
the python file as well, please just ignore it). 
If I clarified something about the code or added sources, it is written in a comment
underneath the code. Further explanations about the meaning, logic or use cases 
of what is displayed are written in markdown text.
follow the links below to get to the relevant parts of the assignment.
