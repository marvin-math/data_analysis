# python-assignment
This program deals with data analysis, particularly the ordinary least squares model. This program requires no interaction of the viewer. The code and 
results are displayed in a jupyter (ipynb) file. 
I just added a python file for the sake of completeness. 
If I clarified something about the code or added sources, it is written in a comment
underneath the code. Further explanations about the meaning, logic or use cases 
of what is displayed are written in markdown text.
follow the links below to get to the relevant parts of the program.
