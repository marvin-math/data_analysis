# python-assignment
This program requires no interaction of the viewer/supervisor. The code and 
results are displayed in a jupyter (ipynb) file. If I clarified something about
the code, it is written in a comment underneath the code. Further explanations 
about the meaning and/or logic of what is displayed are written in markdown text.
